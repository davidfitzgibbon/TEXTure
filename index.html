					<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/34178417">Jason Santa Maria gave a great talk at Build</a> Web designers are very enthusiastic. It's why we stay up till all hours of the night trying to make things "just right" on our projects. However, this means that we look too closesly, and get lost in the details. We can't see the wood from the trees.</p>
